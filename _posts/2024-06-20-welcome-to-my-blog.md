Welcome to _**wpimplementer.com**_, I'm Stefano from Italy and my blog is designed to help you get going in the **WWW**: _Work Wild Web_, as I say.

I'm a guy tinkering with WordPress and the likes (thus the name of this blog), but the resources I'll share will go far beyond WP stuff.

Strangely enough **wpimplementer.com** is not even built upon WordPress but based on _Jekyll_ and hosted on _GitHub Pages_, as it's a personal learning experiment of mine.

Lookin' forward to provide you interesting content, see you soon!
